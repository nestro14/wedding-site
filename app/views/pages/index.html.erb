    <p>Both our ceremony and reception will take place at the Rush Creek Lodge at Yosemite. Because the lodge is 3-3.5hrs away from San Francisco, and the drive can be dangerous at night, we suggest that you join us at the Lodge on Friday April 27th 2018, the day before the wedding. You are welcome to join us the day of the wedding, but we caution against driving back to the Bay Area at night. Refer to the accommodations section for directions to the lodge and room reservations. Refer to things to do for fun activities for your stay at the lodge.</p>

    <h4 style="color:azure;">The Ceremony</h4>
    <p>Please join us on April 28th 2018 at the Rush Creek Lodge ceremony area in the woods from 4:00PM-4:30PM. The ceremony area is a 10 minute walk from the Rush Creek Lodge’s lobby. Wear comfortable shoes if necessary.</p>

    <h4 style="color:azure;">The Reception</h4>
    <p>Cocktail hour will take place after the ceremony at the outside patio of the Event Hall at the Lodge. Enjoy h'orderves, drinks, and s’mores while you catch up with our friends and family. Dinner will take place immediately after the cocktail hour. The rest of the night, we will share our day together with an estimated end time of 10:00PM.</p>

  <h1 class="margin">The Proposal</h1>
  <p>Nestor proposed on a Sunday morning during a weekend family trip to Yosemite. We had dated for 6 years and I was expecting him to pop the question any day now. I had mentioned to Nestor that when he proposed, I would like to have my loved ones present. With my mom and my sister with us, this trip was the perfect moment to do it. On Saturday morning we took a tour from Yosemite valley to Glacier point. Glacier point is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen in my life, at an elevation of 7,214 feet(2,199 m) according to Wikipedia. It reminded me of the pixar movie “Up.” Such a romantic place to be engaged! “My mom and Jackie are here. If he’s going to propose, this is the perfect moment, I thought.” But he didn’t.</p>

  <p>During our tour the guide told us a Yosemite tale about the Bridal Veil falls. The tale says that he or she, who looks at the fall for 60 seconds or two minutes (don’t quote me on it), will be engaged or married within a year. That afternoon, Jackie, Nestor, and I hiked to the Bridal Veil falls. Jokingly, my sister and I stared at the falls for a whole minute. Again, the setting was perfect, the moment was right. We were at the Bridal Veil falls! But he didn’t propose.</p>

  <p>At that point, I was convinced that he wasn’t going to propose on this trip. That night, Jackie and Nestor insisted that we went to bed early and that we woke up at 5AM to watch the sunrise on our last day at Yosemite.</p>

  <p>We overslept! When I woke up I noticed it was beautifully clear outside. I woke them and told them that we were too late for sunrise. My sister seemed way too upset about it, and in a hurry for us to get out. She was also very interested in me picking the right outfit and looking good. They told me we were going to take photos in the park.</p>

  <p>We drove around Yosemite Valley and finally parked right in front of El Capitan. We walked around a little bit, but it was drizzling and too cold to be outside. Nestor told us to wait in the car while he found a good spot for us to take photos. My sister and I had what I thought was a good girl talk while he was gone.</p>

  <p>When he came back he told us that he found something, and we should come see it. He took my hand and walked me to a spot that had what looked like candles in the shape of a heart. When I realized what was happening, I heard the song “A thousand years” playing behind me. I turned around and my sister was recording with her phone and another camera. Nestor was on one knee. As always Nestor didn’t rehearse what he would say. He spoke from his heart and I said yes.<%= image_tag "happy.jpg", :class => "happy-face-img {
    " %></p>

  <p>We went back to our hotel and they told me everything. How these two had it all planned, and were on the edge and acting weird, worried that I would find out. How the candles were meant for the sunrise, and how I they had to erase texts between the two so I wouldn’t find out. How my mom  and Nestor’s family knew too. His proposal was perfect. I loved every detail of it. I loved that my sister was a part of it. I feel so lucky to have them both. I wouldn’t change it for the world.</p>
