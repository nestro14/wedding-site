  <h1 class="margin">The Proposal</h1>
  <p>Nestor proposed on a Sunday morning on our first trip to Yosemite. We had dated for 6 years and I knew he would pop the question any day now. With my mom and my sister with us, this trip was the perfect opportunity to do it. On Saturday morning we took a tour from Yosemite valley to Glacier point. Glacier point is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen in my life, at an elevation of 7,214 feet according to Wikipedia. It reminded me of the movie “Up.” Such a romantic place to be engaged! “My mom and Jackie are here. If he’s going to propose, this is the perfect moment,” I thought. But he didn’t.</p>

  <p>The tour guide told us a Yosemite tale about the Bridal Veil falls. The tale says that he or she, who looks at the fall for 1-2 minutes, will be engaged or married within a year. That afternoon, Jackie, Nestor, and I hiked to the Bridal Veil falls. Jokingly, my sister and I stared at the falls for a whole minute. Again, the setting was perfect, the moment was right. We were at the Bridal Veil falls! But he didn’t propose. At that point, I was convinced that he wasn’t going to propose on this trip. That night, Jackie and Nestor insisted that we wake up early to watch the sunrise on our last day at Yosemite.</p>

  <p>We overslept! When I woke up I noticed it was beautifully clear outside. I woke them and told them that we were too late for sunrise. My sister seemed upset about it and in a hurry for us to get out. We drove around Yosemite Valley and finally parked right in front of El Capitan. It was drizzling and too cold to be outside, so Nestor told us to wait in the car while he found a good spot for pictures.</p>

  <p>When went back to our hotel, they told me everything. How these two had it all planned, and were on the edge, acting weird, and worried that I would find out. How the candles were meant for sunrise. How my mom and Nestor’s family knew too. His proposal was perfect. I loved every detail of it. I loved that my sister was a part of it. I feel so lucky I wouldn’t change it for the world.</p>
